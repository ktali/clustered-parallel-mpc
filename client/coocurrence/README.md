### Client application for running the parallel term-coocurrence program

#### _Input generation and result verification_
Random inputs can be generated by running 

```$ ./generatedata.py <filename> <number of term vectors> <minimum vector length> <maximum vector length>```
 
After running the computation, the secret shared databases named `out-<CLIQUE IDX>.h5` can be combined using the `sharemind-hdf5-csv-exporter` utility program and the resulting CSV outputs checked against a cleartext solve of the problem as follows  

```$ ./checksolution.py <input filename> <path of directory containing 'out-i.csv'>```

#### Tasks

* `sharemind-web-client` has to be installed and its path set in `package.json` under the correct dependency.
* This input file containing term vectors first needs to be converted to JSON with `./inputtojson.py <path-to-input.txt> <nr-of-partitions>`
  * the second argument is the amount of partitions that the inputs will be split into. The partitions are uploaded separately and they have to be small enough to not exceed the socket argument size allowance (~<20 kB).
* Set the required constants in `js/globals.js`
  * `numParts` -- Number of JSON partitions that were created with `./inputtojson.py`
  * `gatewayHosts` -- IP addresses assigned to each clusters gateway service. (Listed under `EXTERNAL-IP` in the output of command `kubectl get svc test-sharemind-web-gateway`)
  * `stripeLength` -- The maximum length of 'stripes' that are calculated (ideally this should be one less than the length of the longest term vector in the inputs)
  * `numMapCliques` -- The degree of parallelism of the map stage
  * `numReduceCliques` -- The degree of parallelism of the reduce stage

#### Running

```
$ npm install
$ node js/node_client.js
```
